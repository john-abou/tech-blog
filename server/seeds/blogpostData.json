        "contents": "Most people are not very familiar with the concept of artificial intelligence (AI). As an illustration, when 1,500 senior business leaders in the United States in 2017 were asked about AI, only 17 percent said they were familiar with it.[1] A number of them were not sure what it was or how it would affect their particular companies. They understood there was considerable potential for altering business processes, but were not clear how AI could be deployed within their own organizations.",

But researchers still have only a limited understanding of how these models work. Whether a given model is optimal for certain task remains an open question.",

Determining whether text has come from artificial intelligence models like ChatGPT might be impossible to do reliably, according to a new mathematical proof. The ease with which AI models generate text that seems as if it were written by a human has led to issues such as cheating on essays and exams, and mass disinformation campaigns. So some people have suggested methods to guard against such uses by embedding a hidden watermark in the …",
